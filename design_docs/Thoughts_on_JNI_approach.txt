Kaleb: I'm trying to figure out how to pass arguments through JNI to
C to manipulate the arguments then back.
Angelica: How about using some sort of text intermediary?

Kaleb: OMFG you solved it.

Solution: JNI will have a native method called "NOTIFY()" This
method will alert C that a file is ready to be opened and read.

C will open the txt document, read out the x and y coordinates of 
the mouse clicked event, perform logic based on these coordinates
then write any prevelent information back to the txt document. Then
update the native notify method alerting java to then open and read
out any information needed etc.
